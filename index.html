 <h3 class="subhead">Why electric vehicle infrastructure still fails many New Yorkers?</h3>

<div class="paragraph">


<p>During Biden Administration, the IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) incentivized drivers to buy Electric Vehicles (EV’s) with a tax credit of 7.500$ for any purchase of a new EV car. 
The drivers followed that incentive and in New York City between 2021 and 2022, there was an increase of 44% of EV registration. However, the essential aspect of an EV is being able to charge it.
 </p>

<p> 

According to Roy Rada, manager for the Con Edison Electric Vehicle Distribution Project in NYC,  half of the EV owners in NYC can not charge at home. 
</p>

<h2>Public vs Private Charging Infrastructure </h2>


<p>
Therefore, the public chargers, which are accessible to everyone, are particularly important for the adoption of EVs. 
</p>

<p>
There are two types of EV chargers, the one owned by for-profit companies such as Blink or the one operated by public agencies such as the Department of Transportation. 
</p>

<p>
“DOT is not operating like a capitalist business. They're not trying to make a profit off of the electricity they sell,” said Roy Rada. 
For instance, at the Bay Ridge Municipal Parking Station, the price to charge an EV is the parking fees + $0.27/kWh. 
Whereas, the chargers owned from for profit companies have an average price of $0.60/kWh according to Roy Rada. 
</p>

<h2>Overstay Issues Affect Access to Charging </h2>
<p>
But according to some recent <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Electric-Vehicle-EV-Charging-Data-Municipal-Lots-a/kj7g-u4gp/about_data" target="_blank">data</a> published by the DOT, some of these public municipal parking lots have more overstay than others. A car overstaying at a charging station hogs the space and prevents others to charge.

</p>

<p>
The Bay Ridge Parking Municipal EV charging station with five Level 2 chargers has for instance an average overstay time of 78 minutes in 2024, meaning that in 2024, the average car remained at the charger for 78 minutes after fully charging.
</p>


<p>
This trend of overstay is not the same in every parking municipal lot, at Delancey Essex with four DC fast chargers for instance, the overstay time was 19 minutes in 2024. 
</p>

<p>  This can be explained for several reasons for John Markowitz, lead engineer at the New York Power Authority : “this behavior could be for a commuter who left their car to go to work, or people living in apartments who left their car and went to sleep.” </p>

<p> Delancey Essex has a higher population density and more commercial activity with many people coming to shop, or commute to work, unlike the more residential Bay Ridge area. </p>
